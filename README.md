# **Invariant Proxy**

Invariant Proxy is a lightweight Docker service that acts as an intermediary between AI Agents and LLM providers (such as OpenAI and Anthropic). It captures and forwards agent interactions to the [Invariant Explorer](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/), enabling seamless debugging, visualization and exploration of traces.

## **Why Use Invariant Proxy?**
- âœ… **Intercept AI interactions** for better debugging and analysis.
- âœ… **Seamlessly forward API requests** to OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers (**supports streaming responses too**).
- âœ… **Automatically store and organize traces** in the Invariant Explorer.

## **Getting Started**
To integrate the Proxy with your AI agent, youâ€™ll need to modify how your client interacts with LLM providers.

1. **Get an Invariant API Key**  
   Follow the instructions [here](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/docs/explorer/Explorer_API/1_client_setup/) to obtain an API key.

### **ðŸ”¹ OpenAI Integration**
2. To setup an OpenAI key follow the steps [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart#create-and-export-an-api-key).

3. **Modify OpenAI Client Setup**  
   Instead of connecting directly to OpenAI, configure your `OpenAI` client to use the proxy.

   ```python
   from httpx import Client
   from openai import OpenAI

   client = OpenAI(
       http_client=Client(
           headers={
               "Invariant-Authorization": "Bearer <invariant-api-key>"
           },
       ),
       base_url="https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/api/v1/proxy/<add-your-dataset-name-here>/openai",
   )

   # Make API requests to OpenAI using the client as usual.

### **ðŸ”¹ Anthropic Integration**
2. To setup an Anthropic key follow the steps [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup#set-your-api-key).

3. **Modify Anthropic Client Setup**  
   Instead of connecting directly to Anthropic, configure your `Anthropic` client to use the proxy.

   ```python
   from httpx import Client
   from anthropic import Anthropic

   client = Anthropic(
       http_client=Client(
           headers={
               "Invariant-Authorization": "Bearer <invariant-api-key>"
           },
       ),
       base_url="https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/api/v1/proxy/<add-your-dataset-name-here>/anthropic",
   )

   # Make API requests to Anthropic using the client as usual.

### Run
```bash
./run.sh up
```

### Run tests
```bash
./run.sh tests
```
